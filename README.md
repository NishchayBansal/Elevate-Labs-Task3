**6.Research simple fixes or mitigations for found vulnerabilities.**

**a) Exploit:** Simple fixes and mitigation strategies include regularly patching software and operating systems, implementing strong access control, and educating employees on safe computing habits.
**b) Backdoor:** Focus on hardening your system security, implementing strong access controls, and regularly scanning for malicious activity. 
**c) Hacktool:**  Implement multi-factor authentication, network segmentation, and strong password policies. Regularly update software and plugins, and conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities. 
**d) VirTool:** Focus on strong password policies, software updates. Additionally, implement endpoint detection and response tools and consider network segmentation to isolate potential breaches. 
**e) Trojan:** Immediately disconnect the device from the internet and boot into Safe Mode to limit the Trojan's functionality. 
Then, install and update reputable antivirus software and run a full system scan to detect and remove the Trojan. 
After removal, change passwords, monitor financial accounts, and practice safe browsing habits. 

**7.Document the most critical vulnerabilities.**
